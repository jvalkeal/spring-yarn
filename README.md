The [Spring for Apache Hadoop Yarn] provides extensions to Spring Framework to build manageable and robust pipeline solutions around Hadoop Yarn.  

# Building

Spring for Apache Hadoop Yarn uses Gradle as its build system. To build the system simply run:

    gradlew clean build

from the project root folder. This will compile the sources, run the tests and create the artifacts.

## Supported distros

As this project is on its early stages it relies on Hadoop's alpha releases from 2.x series(currently hadoop-2.0.3-alpha).
